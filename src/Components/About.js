        <p>
          What first attracted me to web development is my love of learning.
          Learning has always been a huge passion, and web development gives me
          so many opportunities to keep learning and improving. I decided to
          take the next big step of becoming a web developer and enrolled myself
          in Devmountain. Since then my love for technology and web has only grown
          immensely.

          I've always had a passion for mental health, and I have wanted to help
          out where I can. One thing that drew me into web development is the
          ability to combie mental health services with technology to make
          access to mental health treatment easier and better for both clients
          and therapists.

            When I'm not coding you'll see me hiking and exploring the great mountains of Utah, reading a book by a roaring fire, or doing something else amazing.
